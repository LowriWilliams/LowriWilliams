### Lowri Williams

Hi, I'm Lowri - a research data scientist at Cardiff University. 

My interests revolve around nautral language processing, text mining, and sentiment analysis. I occasionally blog about my personal projects and use my Github to repo them. Check out my articles on Medium.

Find me on Twitter or on Codementor where I help mentees with their coding problems.

I mainly code in Python üêç
