Hi, I'm Lowri - a data scientist at Cardiff University. 

My interests revolve around nautral language processing, text mining, and sentiment analysis. I occasionally blog my personal projects and use my Github to repo them. Check out my articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@lowri.a.williams).

Find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Lowri_Williams) or on [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/@lowriawilliams) where I help mentees with their coding problems.
